Three women from a high-tech matriarchal society—a scientist, a diplomat, and a soldier—crash-land on a remote island in an uncharted region of their star system. Stranded with limited supplies, they discover the island is not as uninhabited as it seems. Strange, bioluminescent flora pulses with unnatural energy, and the ruins of an ancient, advanced civilization suggest they’re not the first to arrive.  
As they struggle to survive, they encounter cryptic warnings carved in stone and evidence of a long-lost experiment in human augmentation. The island itself seems to shift subtly, as if hiding something. When one of them starts hearing whispers in a language none of them recognize, they realize: they were brought here for a reason.  
Now, they must uncover the island’s secrets before it consumes them—or before whatever wiped out the last civilization returns.
