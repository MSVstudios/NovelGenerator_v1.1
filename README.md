NovelGenerator V2.5 is a sophisticated Python tool for generating complete novels and fanfiction from just a short paragraph of user input. Using Ollama's large language models, it creates coherent plot structures, develops nuanced characters, and writes in multiple literary styles. You can choose a script variant with a different API provider. Options available include Ollama, ChatGPT, and Claude Sonnet.

While API calls to commercial models like Claude or ChatGPT can produce better results, Ollama version leverages local LLMs to keep it completely free. The innovative architecture of the script cleverly compensates for this quality difference. Simply launch the script and go about your business‚Äîyour book generates completely automatically in the background without requiring your attention or intervention, leaving your hands free for other tasks.

Optional: You can run story_idea_generation.py first - Creative LLM Agents creates book plots by orchestrating three specialized AI models (Architect, Visionary, and Critic) that debate and refine ideas over multiple iterations, transforming a simple user theme into a cohesive narrative concept. This system functions as a sophisticated idea generator, producing well-developed plot foundations that serve as optimal input for the main book generation engine.
