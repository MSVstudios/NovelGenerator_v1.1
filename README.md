# NovelGenerator

NovelGenerator is a Python tool that transforms brief inputs into complete novels using language model technology.

- Leverages Ollama's local LLMs (free) or enterprise APIs (ChatGPT, Claude)
- Implements asynchronous processing for background operation
- Features modular design for configurable literary styles

## Technical Capabilities
- End-to-end pipeline from concept to complete novel
- Entity relationship modeling for character development
- Structured content generation with scene-level granularity
- Persistent state management for consistent world-building
- Algorithmic narrative tension control
- Automated semantic validation with correction protocols
- Multi-pass quality assurance for narrative coherence

## Multi-Agent System
The separate `story_idea_generation.py` script employs a distributed architecture with specialized AI agents (Architect, Visionary, and Critic) that collaboratively refine narrative concepts through iterative debate, transforming simple themes into structured story frameworks.

## üöÄ Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KazKozDev/NovelGenerator.git
cd NovelGenerator
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üíª Usage

1. Start Ollama:
```bash
ollama serve
```
2. Run generator:
```bash
python novel_generator.py
```
Alternative Options:
Two additional scripts are available for different API providers:

- ChatGPT Option: novel_generator_chat_gpt.py

- Sonet Option: novel_generator_sonet.py
