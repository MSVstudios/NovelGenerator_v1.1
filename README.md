NovelGenerator is an LLM-powered tool that expands brief concepts into full-length novels. <br>
From idea to manuscript. Without human intervention.

</div>
<br>
This tool enables writers, storytellers, and LLM enthusiasts to produce complete fiction using either free local LLMs or commercial API services. The entire generation process runs autonomously while maintaining narrative coherence.<br><br>

- End-to-end pipeline from concept to complete novel
- Entity relationship modeling for character development
- Structured content generation with scene-level granularity
- Persistent state management for consistent world-building
- Algorithmic narrative tension control
- Automated semantic validation with correction protocols
- Multi-pass quality assurance for narrative coherence

## Multi-Agent System
The separate `story_idea_generation.py` script employs a distributed architecture with specialized AI agents (Architect, Visionary, and Critic) that collaboratively refine narrative concepts through iterative debate, transforming simple themes into structured story frameworks.
